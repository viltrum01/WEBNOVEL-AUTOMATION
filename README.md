# WEBNOVEL-AUTOMATION
Automated system for tracking web novel updates


## What This Does
Automatically tracks web novel updates and sends email notifications when new chapters are available.

## The Problem I Solved
I was manually checking 3+ web novel websites daily for new chapters. This took 15 minutes every day and I often missed updates.

## How It Works
1. **Google Form** - Easy way to add new series to track
2. **Database** - Stores all my web novel information  
3. **Automation** - Checks for updates and emails me

## What I Built With
- Google Forms (for data entry)
- Zapier Tables (database)
- Zapier Automation (connects everything)
- Email notifications

## Results
- ✅ Reduced checking time from 15 minutes to 0
- ✅ Never miss new chapter updates
